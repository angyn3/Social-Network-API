## Description

Upon utilizing a social network API, upon entering the designated command to initiate the application, the server initiates and seamlessly synchronizes the Mongoose models with the MongoDB database. Upon accessing the API GET routes via Insomnia, specifically for users and thoughts, the data pertaining to each route is presented in a well-structured JSON format. Further interaction involves the assessment of API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes using Insomnia, yielding the successful execution of user and thought creation, updates, and deletions within the database. Moreover, testing API POST and DELETE routes through Insomnia facilitates the smooth creation and deletion of reactions associated with thoughts, alongside the ability to seamlessly add and remove friends from a user's friend list.
